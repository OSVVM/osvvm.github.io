About OSVVM
====================================================

OSVVM is an advanced verification methodology that 
defines a verification framework, VHDL utility library,
VHDL verification component library, and a scripting library.

OSVVM supports the same capabilities that verification languages 
such as SystemVerilog + UVM support - including transaction level modeling, 
verification components, functional coverage, constrained random tests,
Intelligent Coverage random tests, 
data structures (such as scoreboards, FIFOs, and Memories), 
error logging and reporting, message filtering, and 
advanced test reporting (HTML and JUnit XML for CI/CD).

Important benefits of OSVVM:

* You can add it to your current VHDL testbench incrementally.
* It is simple enough to use on small blocks.
* So simple in fact that we don't need a "Lite" or "Easy" approach.
* It is powerful enough to use on large, complex FPGAs and ASICs.
* Using a similar framework for for RTL, Core, and System tests facilitates reuse between them.
* Test reporting in HTML for the entire test suite as well as detailed reports for each test case.
* Using CI/CD?  OSVVM generates JUnit XML used by CI tools. 
* Our Model Independent Transactions (MIT) define a common set of transactions for Address Bus and Streaming Interfaces
* Our transaction based tests are readable by RTL, verification, software, and system engineers.
* Common scripting for all supported simulators (GHDL, Aldec, Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence)
* We don't use OO language constructs so RTL engineers can write test environments.
* It is free open source.
* It upgrades an ordinary VHDL license with full featured verification capabilities. 

OSVVM is developed by the same VHDL experts who 
have helped develop VHDL standards.
We have used our expert VHDL skills to create
advanced verification capabilities that are easy to use.

SynthWorks has been OSVVM for 25+ years in our
training classes and consulting work.
During that time, we have added to our capabilities 
and evolved our approach to increase 
re-use and reduce effort and time spent.
