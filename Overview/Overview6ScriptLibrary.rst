Scripting Library
====================================================
The goal of OSVVM's scripting is to have 
"One Script to Run them All" - where all is any simulator.

Currently supported simulators are:
* GHDL (Free Open Source simulator),
* Aldec's Active-HDL and Riviera-PRO, 
* Siemen's ModelSim and QuestaSim, 
* Synopsys' VCS, and
* Cadence's Xcelium.

OSVVM scripts are a TCL based API layer that provides a 
tool independent means to simulate (and perhaps in the 
future synthesize) your design. 
The API uses TCL procedures to create the abstraction 
layers â€“ which is why they have the extension .pro. 

The scripts are executable TCL, so the full power of TCL 
can be used when needed (such as is in osvvm.pro).
