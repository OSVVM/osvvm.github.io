# Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM)
Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM) reduces the complexity of your verification task by providing utility and model libraries.


## The OSVVM Utility Library
The OSVVM utility library offers the same capabilities as those provided by other verification languages (such as SystemVerilog and UVM):

 - Transaction-Level Modeling
 - Constrained Random test generation
 - Functional Coverage with hooks for UCIS coverage database integration
 - Intelligent Coverage Random test generation
 - Utilities for testbench process synchronization generation
 - Utilities for clock and reset generation
 - Transcript files
 - Error logging and reporting - Alerts and Affirmations
 - Message filtering - Logs
 - Scoreboards and FIFOs (data structures for verification)
 - Memory models

## The OSVVM Model Library
The OSVVM model library provides off the shelf models for:

 - AXI4 Lite Master
 - AXI4 Lite  Slave transactor model
 - AXI Stream Master
 - AXI Stream Slave
 - UART Transmitter (aka master) - with error injection
 - UART Transmitter (aka slave) - with error injection
